Using the demonstration code from today's class, repeat the analysis but use up sampling and tune hyperparameters to try to improve model performance.

You should turn in the following for the assignment

1. Turn in a final knit version of your results, clearly showing the pre and post calibration plots for all three algorithms.

2. Describe your choice of final "optimal" model including why you believe it is the best model. If you decide none of your final models are "optimal", clearly describe why.

3. Describe at least one additional evaluation you would perform if the goal was to implement this model within a clinical setting.
